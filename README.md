<h2>About</h2>
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
In the current situation outside an efficient tool is required which predicts the presence of COVID-19 virus and give more awareness about it. 
COVID-19 detector is a web application which predicts COVID-19 virus from the chest x-ray of a person.

<h2>Functionalities</h2>
Predicts whether a person is COVID-19 affected or not.<br>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
Convolutional Neural networks<br>
Python<br>
Keras<br>
Flask<br>

<h2>Note</h2>
The results obtained from here are not totally reliable as the accuracy can be improved further. This is just a proposed alternative whose efficiency can still be improved.
